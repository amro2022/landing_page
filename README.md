# A very important note.

I have done this project four times after several modifications:  
the first of which asked her to modify and I made it, then he came back to me with cheating on my part and this is a very big joke and not appropriate.

After After that, you thankfully removed this error.

Then I submitted the project for the third time, and he asked me to amend it as well, and I completed it, and he accused me of cheating as well, and you also uploaded it, as I think.

This time, I hope to accept the project and finish it, as I have done all the requirements in it and I want to devote myself to the work of the other project and complete the course.
